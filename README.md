[Aperture live](https://aperture-go.herokuapp.com)

Aperture is a full-stack web application modeled after Flickr. It was developed with a Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL relational database, and a React.js/Redux architecture frontend. This project was designed and built within a two week timeframe and planned improvements that will be added over time.

Aperture allows users to view and share their photos with the world. It will let users create their own photos, as well as explore photos from other users. Comments can be left on all photos and tags can be added also.

Users are directed to an idividual photo show page after clicking on a photo. If they are the owner of the photo, icons are displayed where they user can edit or delete the photo. Users are also able to comment on and tag photos. Comments can be deleted if the user is the owner of the photo or if it is their own comment, otherwise the delete button will not appear when hovering over the comment.
